Functional Requirements:

    1. Date Input: The GUI should have a text field where the user can input a date in a specific format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
    2. Search Button: A button to initiate the API search when clicked.
    3. API Call: The program should use the Congress API to search for data corresponding to the input date.
    4. Error Handling for Input: The program should validate the date input and display an error message for invalid formats.
    5. Error Handling for API: The program should handle API errors gracefully, such as network issues or no data found for the given date.
    6. Result Display: The program should display the search results in the GUI in a user-friendly format, such as a table or list.
    7. Clear Search: A button to clear the input field and search results.

User Experience:

    1. User-Friendly Interface: The GUI should be intuitive, with labels and placeholders guiding the user.
    2. Loading Indicator: While the API search is being processed, the GUI should display a loading message or spinner.
    3. Responsive Design: Ensure the GUI components resize or adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.

Technical Requirements:

    1. Congress API Integration: Implement a function to send a GET request to the Congress API with the input date.
    2. Data Parsing: Parse the API response to extract relevant data for display.
    3. PyQt5 Framework: Use PyQt5 for the GUI implementation.
    4. Environment Setup: Provide a clear instruction file (README.md) for setting up dependencies, including PyQt5 and any API libraries like requests.

Non-Functional Requirements:

    1. Performance: The program should retrieve and display results within a reasonable time (< 3 seconds for API response).
    2. Scalability: The program should handle multiple searches without crashing.
    3. Maintainability: The code should be modular and well-documented for future updates or bug fixes.

Stretch Goals (Optional):

    1. Date Picker Widget: Replace the text field with a calendar widget for easier date selection.
    2. Export Results: Allow users to export the search results as a CSV or JSON file.
    3. Search History: Implement a feature to save and display past searches within the GUI.
    4. Advanced Filtering: Add options for additional filters (e.g., bill type, sponsor).
